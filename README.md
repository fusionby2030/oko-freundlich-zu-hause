# oko-freundlich-zu-hause

This repository is a collection of ways to be environemtnally friendly at home. There are lots of resources on the web available (which we often will source each object to) that do a good job at this, however we started this to make a list for ourselves, and hopefully it expands from there. 
Some websites that do a good job already:

Here is a bunch of things you can do to be environmentally concious with the taking care of the flora around you. Some sites to help: [site 1](http://thegirlintheocean.com/14-tricks-zero-waste-eco-friendly-indoor-gardening/),  [site 2](https://pebblemag.com/magazine/eating-drinking/sustainable-gardening-eco-friendly-tips), [site 3](https://www.realhomes.com/advice/creating-an-eco-friendly-garden)
#### Replace Plastic Pots or trays with recyled packaging. 
Egg Boxes, yoghurt pots, jars, clean ice cream tubs. These all work as containers for your plants. 
#### Pest Control 
Knock flies off plants with water spray (water can be flavoured with grinding garlic, or rhubarb, or soap)
Dill and Fennel will attract flies that eat other flies 

#### Friendly planting 
- Onions + Chives grown around Roses fight back the black spot disease 
- Carrots + Leeks repel eachothers garden pests 
- Basil + Tomatoes makes tomatoes tastier 
- Horseradish + Potatoes increases resistance to disease 

#### Fertilizer 
- Banana Tea 
	- Make sure your bananas are Bio (organic). We don't want those nasty pesticides! GMO is okay. 
	- Soak banana peels in water for a week (in a rush then low heat for 2 hours boiling water)
- Tea Leaves 
	- Mix leftover tea with soil 
- Epson Salt 

#### Watering 
- Rain water (if Possible) 
	- Water butts (check your local gardening shop) 
- Cooking water 
	- Pasta (Unsalted Pasta) 
	- Boiled Veggies
